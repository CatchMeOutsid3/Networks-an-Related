# Networks-an-Related

A repository for my projects. The tshark project is a work in progress. Right now, you are able to view the packets of a captured file and soon,
you will be able to see the packets of malware automatically.

 
Usage:  Open your terminal in the same location that you have placed this file.
        Type: sh mfer
        
        Hint: Place Pcap in the same directory so you, only have to provide a name of the file when you are asked for the place of the pcap.
